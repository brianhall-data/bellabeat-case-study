# Bellabeat Case Study

## Project Overview
This project is a data analysis case study for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. As a junior data analyst on the marketing analytics team, I analyzed smart device usage data to gain insights into consumer behavior and provide high-level recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy.

## Company Background
Bellabeat was founded by Urška Sršen and Sando Mur, offering a range of products designed to empower women with knowledge about their health and habits. Bellabeat's product line includes:

- **Bellabeat App**: Tracks health data such as activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits.
- **Leaf**: A wellness tracker that can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip.
- **Time**: A wellness watch that combines classic design with smart technology.
- **Spring**: A smart water bottle that tracks daily water intake.
- **Bellabeat Membership**: Provides personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health, beauty, and mindfulness.

## Objective
The main objective of this case study is to analyze smart device usage data and provide actionable insights to help Bellabeat expand its market presence. The analysis will focus on the following key questions:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?
